# Image Classification using PyTorch and CIFAR-10

This project implements an image classification model using **PyTorch** trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The goal is to build a deep learning model that accurately classifies 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.
